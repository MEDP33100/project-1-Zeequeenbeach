# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

- This project is an interactive adaptation of the popular nursery rhyme Sing a Song for Sixpence.
- As users scroll, they can read the rhyme while a version of the melody plays in the background. Each illustration moves gently, pausing when you hover over it.

## Figma Design

- [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/board/rF4sH8DIsy0T58ZEpnpSrR/Sing-a-Song-for-Sixpence?node-id=0-1&t=wmg4V90nqKO5tiqL-1)
- I knew I wanted to implement a horizontal scroll, so I first mapped out the placement of each image and text as they appeared across the screen.
- From there, I decided which animations and sound effects to incorporate and when they should occur.

## Features

- CSS Animations
    - Images have a subtle float effect to create movement and visual interest.
    - Hovering over an image pauses the animation to prevent distractions.
    - "The End" text flickers, highlighting the conclusion of the site and story.
- GSAP Animations
    - The horizontal scrolling effect helps the story to flow.
    - Images slide smoothly into view as they appear on the screen.
- Sound Effects
    - A click sound occurs when "Begin" is clicked. It readies the user for the music.
    - The entire story is accompanied by a version of the rhyme's melody. The sound helps to immerse the user in the story.
- User-Triggered Events
    - The pop-up appears when the page loads, and users must click "Begin" to proceed. Clicking "Begin" closes the pop-up and plays the music.
    - Hovering over an image pauses any distracting animations. 
    - Scrolling through the website allows you to continue reading. 
- Responsive Design 
    - Desktop: Images and text are placed side by side with plenty of space, resulting in a balanced layout and readability.
    - Tablet: The layout is kept side by side but scaled down slightly. Images are reduced to about 45% width, and text size is slightly reduced to ensure readability without overwhelming the screen.
    - Mobile: The design remains side by side while adjusting for smaller screens. Images and text take up less space, with fewer gaps between them.

## Future Enhancements

- I would add more animations to the images. I would want to animate what the line was describing in further detail.
